# Unity Catalog Converted Python File
# This file has been automatically converted for Unity Catalog compatibility using the PyUCX-AI Multi-Agent Framework.
#
# Changes Made:
# - Updated table references to use three-part naming (catalog.schema.table)
# - Modified Spark configurations for Unity Catalog
# - Updated SQL queries for UC compatibility
# - Added Unity Catalog-specific configurations
# - Preserved original import statements (imports are not modified during UC conversion)
#
# Next Steps:
# 1. Review the converted code for accuracy
# 2. Test the file in your Unity Catalog environment
# 3. Update any hardcoded catalog/schema names as needed
# 4. Verify data access permissions
#
# Data Analytics Dashboard
# Advanced analytics using Databricks and PySpark with legacy table references.

from pyspark.sql.functions import *

# Load analytics data from hive_metastore
analytics_df = spark.sql('SELECT * FROM analytics.user_behavior')
events_df = spark.read.table('analytics.event_log')
metrics_df = spark.read.table('analytics.performance_metrics')

# Complex analytics queries
user_stats = spark.sql('''
    SELECT customer_id, 
           COUNT(*) as total_events, 
           SUM(event_value) as total_value
    FROM analytics.event_log e
    JOIN analytics.user_profiles u ON e.user_id = u.customer_id
    WHERE event_date >= '2024-01-01'
    GROUP BY customer_id
''')

# Save results using databricks utilities
user_stats.write.saveAsTable('catalog1.analytics.analytics_summary'))

# Use dbutils for file operations
# TODO: Review file path for Unity Catalog compatibility
